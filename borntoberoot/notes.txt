Hypervisor: A hypervisor is also known as the virtual machine monitor (VMM) 
		and controls the resources of the host machine and allocates to each VM 
		the resources it needs (memory, CPU...)


firewall: a firewall acts like a security guard. Its job is to watch over the flow of 
			information between your computer or network and the internet.
			"helps keep your digital world safe"
			Firewall match the network traffic against the rule set defined in its table 
			'also firewall can be in hardware of software'

	types od FIREWALL:
		proxy firewall || packet filtering firewall || next-generation firewalls || staful multilayer inspection firewall


VirtualBox: It's an open-source software that you will find on your Mac
		It acts as a hypervisor, creating a VM (virtual machine)
		where the user can run another OS


Debian :was one of the first Linux distributions and has been available since 1993 
		offers a higher degree of control and customization of its configuration


why debain and not rocky:
			- AppArmor is easier to learn than SELinux (which comes with Rocky "witch are devloped by us nsa")
			- Password policy configuration is more straightforward
			- UFW (firewall) is simpler to configure than firewalld
			- LVM setup process is well
			- System monitoring is easier to implement


systeme adminestration: An operating system acts as an interface between
			the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware
			'can manage the overall resources and operations of the computer'
			Examples: of Operating Systems are Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc...


OS (Operating System): software which performs all the basic tasks like 
			file management, memory management, process management, 
			handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as 
			disk drives and printers.
			The software that contains the core components of the operating system is called the KERNEL.

			Operating System are to enable applications (spftwares) to interact with a computer's
			hardware and to manage a system's hardware and software resources.

SSH 'secureshell': is a network protocol that helps users connect to another computer over an unsecured network.
					network protocol uses encryption to allow two connected devices 'srever and client'.
			TELNET is a type of protocol that enables one computer to connect to the local computer. /FTP

The term "boot" in computing refers to the process of starting up a computer and loading the operating system (OS)
				into memory so that the system becomes usable. The word "boot" comes from the phrase "bootstrapping,
			" which originally referred to a self-starting process, much like pulling oneself up by one’s bootstraps.


LVM :
			Physical Volume (PV):
			Logical Volume (LV) :
			


waht every paretion represent in the bonus table:
	Partition Primary: typically the first partition type created on a new disk.
						A hard drive can have up to four primary partitions.
	Logical Partitions:	Definition: Logical partitions are created within an extended partition,
						which acts as a container for additional partitions.



			each name represents a specific partition or logical volume
			"hat serves a distinct function within the Linux file system"

sda: The main disk, which could be your entire virtual hard drive in VirtualBox.

sda1: The boot partition, typically small (e.g., 500 MB) and mounted at /boot,
		containing the kernel and bootloader files.

sda2: This is often a small partition used for alignment; in this setup, it's only 1 KB.

sda5_crypt: This is an encrypted partition that houses all the logical volumes.
		Inside this encrypted partition, LVM is used to manage logical volumes.



root: 	is in SUPERUSER account. It has full administrative privileges and 
		unrestricted access to all files, commands,and system settings.
1.Administrative Power:
	The root user can do anything on the system, such as:
	Installing or removing software.
	Modifying system configuration files.
	Managing other users and groups.
	Accessing or modifying any file, regardless of permissions.

2.Default User for Administration:
	When the system is installed, the root account is created by default.
	It is often used for system maintenance and troubleshooting.

3.Home Directory:
	The root user's home directory is typically located at /root.

4.Command Prompt:
	The root user's shell prompt usually ends with a # (e.g., root@hostname:/root#),
	 while regular users have a $.


Primary Partition
Definition: A primary partition is one of the main partitions on a disk that can 
			directly host a file systemLogical Partition
Definition: A logical partition is a subdivision of an extended partition and is
			used to bypass the 4-primary-partition limit of MBR.





What is APT?
APT (Advanced Package Tool) is a package management system used in Debian-based
Linux distributions (like Ubuntu) to handle software installation, updates, and removal. It simplifies the process of managing software on your system by automating the retrieval, installation, and configuration of packages.

apt update|	           Updates the local package index with the latest information from configured repositories.
apt upgrade|	       Installs updates for all the packages currently installed on your system.
apt install <package>| Installs a specific package.
apt remove <package>|  Removes a specific package while keeping configuration files.
apt purge <package>|   Completely removes a package along with its configuration files.
apt search <keyword>|  Searches for a package related to the given keyword.
apt show <package>|	   Displays detailed information about a package.
apt autoremove|	       Removes unnecessary packages that were automatically installed and are no longer needed.
apt clean|			   Clears the local cache of downloaded package files.

APTITUDE VS APT

aptitude: remembers which packages were explicitly requested and which were 
			only installed due to dependencies. It will automatically uninstall packages which were 
			not explicitly requested when they are no longer needed.
apt: will only do explicitly what it is told to do in the command line



ask:
encrypted partitions :Definition: A disk partition where all data is stored in an encrypted format,
						 requiring a password, key file, or hardware token for decryption.
Purpose: Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access,
		 especially if the physical device is stolen or compromised
